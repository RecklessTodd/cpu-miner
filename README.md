Algorithms
==========
#### Currently supported
 * âœ“ Argon2D ( CRDS)

Dependencies
============
 * libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
 * jansson http://www.digip.org/jansson/ (jansson source is included in-tree)
 * openssl libcrypto https://www.openssl.org/
 * pthreads
 * zlib (for curl/ssl)

Build
=====

#### Note for Debian/Ubuntu users:

```
 apt-get install automake autoconf pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libssl-dev libgmp-dev make g++
```

#### Basic *nix build instructions:

```
 ./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
 ./nomacro.pl	# only needed if building on Mac OS X or with Clang
 ./configure --with-crypto --with-curl 
 or
  ./configure --with-crypto --with-curl --disable-avx2 # if building for a machine without AVX2 support 
 make
```

#### Basic Windows build with Visual Studio 2013
 * All the required .lib files are now included in tree (windows only)
 * AVX enabled by default for x64 platform (AVX2 and XOP could also be used)

Usage instructions
==================
Run "cpuminer --help" to see options.

### Connecting through a proxy

Use the --proxy option.

To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host  
Protocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also available since libcurl 7.18.0.

If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.  
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy and all_proxy environment variables.
