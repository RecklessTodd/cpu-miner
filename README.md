CPUMiner-Multi
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi)

This is a multi-threaded CPU miner,
fork of [pooler](//github.com/pooler)'s cpuminer (see AUTHORS for list of contributors).

Algorithms
==========
#### Currently supported
 * âœ“ Argon2D ( CRDS)

Dependencies
============
 * libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
 * jansson http://www.digip.org/jansson/ (jansson source is included in-tree)
 * openssl libcrypto https://www.openssl.org/
 * pthreads
 * zlib (for curl/ssl)

Download
========
 * Windows releases: https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi/releases
 * Git tree:   https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi
   * Clone with `git clone https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi`

Build
=====

#### Basic *nix build instructions:
 * just use `./build.sh`
_OR_

```
 ./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
 ./nomacro.pl	# only needed if building on Mac OS X or with Clang
 ./configure CFLAGS="*-march=native*" --with-crypto --with-curl
 # Use -march=native if building for a single machine
 make
```

#### Note for Debian/Ubuntu users:

```
 apt-get install automake autoconf pkg-config libcurl4-openssl-dev libjansson-dev libssl-dev libgmp-dev make g++
```

#### Note for pi64 users:

```
 ./configure --disable-assembly CFLAGS="-Ofast -march=native" --with-crypto --with-curl
```

#### Notes for AIX users:
 * To build a 64-bit binary, export OBJECT_MODE=64
 * GNU-style long options are not supported, but are accessible via configuration file

#### Basic Windows build with Visual Studio 2013
 * All the required .lib files are now included in tree (windows only)
 * AVX enabled by default for x64 platform (AVX2 and XOP could also be used)

#### Basic Windows build instructions, using MinGW64:
 * Install MinGW64 and the MSYS Developer Tool Kit (http://www.mingw.org/)
   * Make sure you have mstcpip.h in MinGW\include
 * install pthreads-w64
 * Install libcurl devel (http://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
   * Make sure you have libcurl.m4 in MinGW\share\aclocal
   * Make sure you have curl-config in MinGW\bin
 * Install openssl devel (https://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html)
 * In the MSYS shell, run:
   * for 64bit, you can use `./mingw64.sh` else :
     `./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo`
   ```
   LIBCURL="-lcurldll" ./configure CFLAGS="*-march=native*"
   # Use -march=native if building for a single machine
   make
    ```

#### Architecture-specific notes:
   * The miner checks for SSE2 instructions support at runtime, and uses them if they are available.

Usage instructions
==================
Run "cpuminer --help" to see options.

### Connecting through a proxy

Use the --proxy option.

To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy host  
Protocols socks4a and socks5h, allowing remote name resolving, are also available since libcurl 7.18.0.

If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.  
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy and all_proxy environment variables.
